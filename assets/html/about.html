                    My Personal Training clientele and specialties stretch across a broad spectrum. My
                    athletic background has allowed me to train athletes as young as 6 years old to 18
                    years old. These sports included baseball, basketball, volleyball, swimming and
                    track. All athletes underwent power and strength training to maximize performance.
                    Previous clients also include prehabilitation and flexibility. Who performed ROM
                    assessment paired with various flexibility techniques to improve and prevent injury.
                    Lastly, the large portion of past clientele is general health and fitness. General health
                    and fitness is the gateway into living a better life. Your health and fitness are
                    something that you cannot take for granted and will allow you to live every day to
                    the fullest.
